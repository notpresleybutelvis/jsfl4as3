Requirements
1. FlashDevelop
2. Flex SDK (comes pre-installed with FlashDevelop), you can also download from http://flex.apache.org/installer.html
3. We use a FlashDevelop plugin to create swc files from the source, it's called ExportSWC, version 4.2.  More information here: http://www.flashdevelop.org/community/viewtopic.php?t=2987

Note: You may alternatively use any Editor to code and mxmlc to create the SWC files from Flash Builder directly too
